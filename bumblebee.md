**Background** : This is an analysis of an unpacked bumblebee 

Bumblebee has two exports. As it is a dll, it's exports important because they contain the main functions of the malware.
We are going to look at the export starting at ```start	0000000140057D2C	[main entry]```
This is the 'main' function of the malware.
